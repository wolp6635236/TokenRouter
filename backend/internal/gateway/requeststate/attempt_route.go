// attempt_route.go resolves provider protocol attempts from request routing
// state and retains the model selected for each admitted attempt.
// Provider capabilities can change between selections even when the request
// keeps its group plan. Candidate resolution therefore rechecks the current
// provider snapshot against the client protocol before a later attempt uses a
// route.
//
// A saved plan is usable only while its group matches the captured group.
// Without a saved plan, an existing attempt protocol can be retained for
// compatibility, otherwise the state builds a capability route from the current
// group. Only an admitted saved plan publishes a CandidatePlan to callers;
// that candidate retains the final model and metadata identity with its
// protocol. Legacy calls without a model plan resolve supplied mappings when
// requested. A new candidate reads a fresh snapshot before execution, so a
// retry can observe changed aliases without altering an in-flight attempt.

// AttemptRoute records one candidate's protocol and optional admitted model
// plan.
